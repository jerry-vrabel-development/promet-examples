# Integrating Cypress for E2E Testing in Drupal 10

This document outlines the process of integrating Cypress, a next-generation front end testing tool built for the modern web, into a Drupal 10 environment for end-to-end (E2E) testing. Cypress simplifies testing by running tests in the same run-loop as your application.

## Prerequisites

Before integrating Cypress with Drupal 10, ensure the following requirements are met:

- A running Drupal 10 site
- Node.js (Preferably the latest LTS version)
- Basic familiarity with JavaScript and E2E testing concepts

## Installation

1. **Set Up Your Testing Environment**: Create a dedicated directory for your tests if you haven't already. This helps in managing your test suite separately from your Drupal installation.

   ```bash
   mkdir drupal-cypress-tests
   cd drupal-cypress-tests
   ```

2. **Initialize a New Node.js Project**: If your test directory is separate from any Node.js project, initialize a new one by running:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

3. **Install Cypress**: Install Cypress via npm as a dev dependency to your project.

   ```bash
   npm install cypress --save-dev
   ```

4. **Open Cypress for the First Time**: This step helps in verifying the installation and also initializes the default folder structure for your tests.

   ```bash
   npx cypress open
   ```

   After executing this command, Cypress will open its Test Runner and create a `cypress` folder structure within your project, containing example tests.

## Writing Your First Test

Navigate to the `cypress/integration` folder that Cypress generated. This is where you'll store your test files.

1. **Create a New Test File**: For Drupal, you might start with a basic test to check if your homepage loads correctly. Create a new file called `homepage_spec.js` inside the `integration` folder.

2. **Define Your Test**: Open `homepage_spec.js` in your text editor and add the following test case:

   ```javascript
   describe('Drupal Homepage Test', () => {
     it('successfully loads', () => {
       cy.visit('http://promet.ddev.site/')
     });
   });
   ```

   This test simply navigates to your Drupal homepage and verifies that it loads successfully.

## Running Tests

With your first test ready, you can run it using the Cypress Test Runner.

1. **Open the Test Runner**:

   ```bash
   npx cypress open
   ```

2. **Run Your Test**: In the Test Runner window, click on `homepage_spec.js`. Cypress will execute the test in a new browser window and display the results.

## Continuous Integration

Cypress can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to automate testing with every build or deployment. For integrating with popular CI providers like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI, refer to the [Cypress documentation on CI](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/introduction).

## Conclusion

Cypress offers a robust solution for E2E testing in a Drupal environment, ensuring your site performs as expected across updates and changes. By integrating Cypress into your development workflow, you can catch issues early, improve quality, and deliver a better experience to your users.
